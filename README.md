# Local Dev Setup:

[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/) installation is required to 
run this application. It is recommend to first read Flask documentation for an understanding of
how the framework operates. Installation commands are dependent upon the user's operating system 
and python version. The latest version of Python 3 is recommended. Commands can be found 
in the [installation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/#) and [quickstart](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/) sections of the Flask docs.
